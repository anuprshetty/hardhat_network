# Hardhat Network

Hardhat network deployment on docker container.

## Notes

- a local node is created with a built-in blockchain that can be used to simulate transactions and interactions with smart contracts.
- The node also has pre-funded accounts with test ether, which can be used for testing transactions without spending real money.
